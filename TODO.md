# Upstream fixes needed

## Wildcards in bpftrace

When trying to probe without specifying the path, I get an error with bpftrace:

```
bpftrace -e 'usdt::ruby:method__entry { @[probe]++}' -p 1271
Wildcard matches aren't available on probe type 'usdt'
No probes to attach
```

This can likely be fixed, or else other helpers added to access the probe and provider fired by a USDT probe, which is the desired behavior.

We should generally support wildcard behavior for USDT probes.

https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/issues/493

NOTE: Until https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/pull/508 is merged, to test wildcards a branch build of bpftrace is needed.

## Namespace collisions upstream

https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/cc/usdt/usdt.cc#L296-L320 
https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/1527
https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2275

There is a bug in libbcc/bpftrace that will result in namespaces to be ignored, eg:
if you have two providers with the same `show`, they will shadow each other.
We want `module_a:show` and `module_b:show` to be namespaced by their provider name and not colide.

- Add support for namespaced providers in lib bcc, upstream this
 - It's a known bug, find the bug id
  - Leave the current interface (accepting only 3 params)
   - Add deprecation warning? Can always remove this in PR.
  - Create a new interface (accepting 4 params)
   - check if the 4th param is null and use original 3 param implementation if so
   - Otherwise, use the 4th param (provider) instead of defaulting to path name
- Modify bpftrace to wrap this function using new interface (specifying provider)
 - Upstream this once 

NOTE: Until https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/2294 is merged, a brached bcc must me used.

## Semaphore incrementing

This isn't very urgent as probes generated by libstapsdt don't need a semaphore, but
this will be required for support to ruby's builtin dtrace probes.

https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2230

We need to disable container OS memory protection in order to use this.

In Kernel 4.20+, we should be able to use a kernel facility to increment the semaphore, rather
than relying on opening and writing to the processess memory image at the semaphore offset.

Once support for this is added to bcc, it should be ported into bpftrace so that enabling
a probe in bpftrace increments the semaphore in the usdt probe through bcc, and the kernel,
rather than by writing to the processess memory image directly from userspace.

This is needed for access to ruby's general USDT probes, which require a sempahore to implement is-enabled

## Semaphore support in libstapsdt

While not strictly needed, this would be nice to stay consistent.

It would be good to see if there is any performance benefit to using the semaphore based approach over just
relying no the uprobe trap point.
