- See if it's ok to build the static library, or if we need to force building the dylib only for libusdt

- current implementation hacks libusdt onto the system, which isn't great.
- Ideally, we should package the libusdt we build alongside the gem.
- We need a way to have the gem installer run the code to install libusdt.dylib, and run `install_name_tool` on the ruby_static_tracing.bundle

- Need to see if i can have multiple extconf files, nad in what order they are executed.
- Have a special extconf for libusdt that installs it to the same directory, but uses its own make file

- Could also write a custom makefile that does the install of libusdt, and install_name_tool if i can find the correct paths.
